I use the following symbolic links structure on our servers and wrote a bash script for handling drupal updates years ago.

Within this structure and this drush command, it is now possible to do that via drush.

Now can drush update drupal. 

Here is the very specific structure this command deals with for multi drupalupdate and multi create:

 drupal/
 |-- 6.x -> drupal-6.14
 |-- 6.x_backup
 |-- 6.x_sites
 |   |--all
 |   |   |-- modules
 |   |   `-- themes
 |   |-- default
 |   `-- example.com
 |      |-- files
 |      |-- modules
 |      `-- themes
 `-- drupal-6.14
     |-- backup -> ../6.x_backup
     |-- includes
     |-- misc
     |-- modules
     |-- profiles
     |-- scripts
     `-- sites  -> ../6.x_sites


INSTALLATION
------------

You can put the multi in a number of places:

  - In a .drush folder in your HOME folder.
  - Along with one of your existing modules. If your command is
    related to an existing module, this is the preferred option.
  - In a folder specified with the include option.
  - In /path/to/drush/commands (not a "Smart Thing to Do", but it would work).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Since this is a drush command, you need drush.
For the installation of drush see the drush README.txt 
at http://cvs.drupal.org/viewvc/drupal/contributions/modules/drush/README.txt?revision=1.29&view=markup
